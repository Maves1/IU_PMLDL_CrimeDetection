\begin{abstract}
	This report describes our attempts at joke generation. Briefly speaking, we tried both fine-tuning a pre-trained GPT-2 and
    training a GPT from scratch (with resources available, of course).

\section{Training a GPT from Scratch}

We also came up with an idea of training a GPT from scratch. We found an implementation [TODO: parameters] and trained it on the dataset
of jokes from Reddit [TODO: link].

\subsection{Data Preprocessing}

\paragraph{}
Dataset of our choice is a simple .csv file with each entry being a complete joke.

\paragraph{}
In order to train the model, we decided to
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Tokenize each entry
	\item Add "end of text" token to each entry
	\item Combine all preprocessed entries into a single long list of tokens
\end{enumerate}
